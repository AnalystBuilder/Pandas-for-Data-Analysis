### Overview

Hello everyone and welcome to the Pandas for Data Analysis course!
 
Pandas is one of the best and most popular Data Analysis libraries in Python! Throughout the course, you'll gain in-depth knowledge of Pandas, including Data Cleaning, Data Exploration, and Data Visualization! With hands-on exercises and real-world projects, you'll develop the skills needed to use Pandas as a Data Analyst. One of the main highlights of this course is the hands-on, guided projects which offer real world projects that you can add to your portfolio. By the end of this Pandas Course, you'll be able to confidently add Pandas to your resume and start using it in your job!

I absolutely love Pandas! I've used Pandas for many years in my actual job and taught tens of thousands of people how to use it as well! I really look forward to teaching you how to use Pandas (as well as other libraries in this course) for Data Analysis!

This course uses videos, practice questions, and guided projects to help you learn!

For datasets, you‚Äôll find them in the ‚ÄúResources‚Äù at the bottom of each lesson.
